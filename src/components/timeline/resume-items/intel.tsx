        Worked as a contingent worker at Intel Facilities on internal
        applications using Asp.net MVC, WebAPI and AngularJS and KendoUI. Agile
        practices were followed and constant validation was had with my
        employer. I delivered well tested code constantly according to business
        needs.

        I also worked had the chance to give maintenance to 6 other applications
        where I was forced to learn them quickly to provide the necessary
        support. Constantly being pushed to learn more and figure out how to
        give proper backing to applications that nobody in the department knew
        how to tackle. I proactively communicated whatever was needed so that my
        work was as streamlined as could have been.
